# Potential Null Dereference in Dart using Null-Aware Operator

This repository demonstrates a potential null dereference issue in Dart code that uses the null-aware operator (??). While the null-aware operator helps handle null values gracefully in many cases, it doesn't fully prevent all potential null dereferences, particularly when combined with other operations.

## Description

The `bug.dart` file contains a simple class `MyClass` with an optional integer variable `_myVariable`. The `myMethod()` function uses the null-aware operator (??) to print the value of `_myVariable`, displaying 'Variable is null' if it's null. The main function creates an instance of `MyClass` with a null value, then calls `myMethod()`. While this seems safe, it might lead to unexpected behavior if further operations are performed on  `_myVariable` without proper null checks.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` provides a solution by using a more robust null check before using the variable. This ensures that null values are handled appropriately, preventing any unexpected null dereferences.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `bug.dart` file. Observe the output.
3. Run the `bugSolution.dart` file. Compare the output and behavior with the original code.
